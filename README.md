# FinalProject

This is my final project for my online CSC 150 class.
I am currently writting this at the beginning and I am very excited to start!
I plan on using this as my diary so to speak and will post updates
of my progress here!

I have decided that I will try my hand at coding Connect 4! I played online
against a bot to kind of get a feel for how it should play and what the board
size needed to be. the 'original' is 6 rows by 7 columns so I will start with that
but it would be fun to ask the user what dimension of board they would like to play.
Im going to start with the basics first.

My brain has already melted about 3 times so far. I got the board to print how I wanted it 
Letters on the left side in and numbers at the top. I figured the letters on the left would be
a good visual representation for the user even though Im going to only have them imput the
column number and then have their piece 'fall' to the bottom like normal connect 4. I expect the
'falling' part to be the most difficult.

It has been a while since I posted anything. I have been a groomsmen at a wedding from wed-sun of
last week and it took me sometime of working hard to get where I am. SO status update. I think
I am right on schedule. I have a function for initializing the board and one for printing it. 
In my main I have a print statement that states Lets Connect 4! My next problem is going to be 
trying to sort out my win condition which I am absolutely going to make at least 1 function out of
and also I need to start figuring out how I am going to tackle the gravity thing. But so far my board
prints and I am very happy about that!
